				<h2>What are Pokémon?</h2>
				<p>
					Pokémon are “monsters” that have special powers and share the world
					with humans. There are different types or categories of Pokémon: Bug,
					Fighting, Fire, Flying, Dragon, Electric, Ghost, Grass, Ground, Ice,
					Normal, Poison, Psychic, Rock, and Water. Within each type are several
					different Pokémon, each possessing various abilities.
				</p>
				<p>
					They can evolve and pass through various levels, 100 being the
					highest. There are also special stones (Fire, Leaf, Moon, Thunder, and
					Water) that can be used to force some Pokémon to evolve into more
					powerful creatures. Of course, after normal development in skill
					learning, various Pokémon often evolve on their own.

				<h2>Starter Pokémon</h2>
				<p>
					Starter Pokémon, or Starters, are the Pokémon a Trainer chooses at the
					beginning of their Pokémon journey and the main protagonists of the
					Pokémon series of games. In each generation of Pokémon games, a set of
					Starter Pokémon are available for new Trainers to choose from in sets
					of three; the types that make up these sets are Fire, Grass, and
					Water. Each starter Pokémon has three evolutionary forms.

						<h3>Bulbasaur #1</h3>

							on its back. By soaking up the sun's rays, the seed grows
							progressively larger.
						</p>
						<p>
							It is a Grass/Poison type Pokémon, which makes it weak against
							Fire, Flying, Ice and Psychic moves.

						<h3>Charmander #4</h3>
						<p>
							The flame that burns at the tip of its tail is an indication of
							its emotions. The flame wavers when Charmander is enjoying itself.
							If the Pokémon becomes enraged, the flame burns fiercely.
						</p>
						<p>
							Charmander is a Fire type Pokémon, which makes it weak against
							Ground, Rock and Water moves.

						<h3>Squirtle #7</h3>
						<p>
							Squirtle's shell is not merely used for protection. The shell's
							rounded shape and the grooves on its surface help minimize
							resistance in water, enabling this Pokémon to swim at high speeds.
						</p>
						<p>
							Squirtle is a Water type Pokémon, which makes it weak against
							Grass and Electric moves.
